# cornershop_estimator
My take on a Cornershop time estimator model,

* Final submission can be found on submission.csv
* Explanation on submission found on Notebook #00.
* Explanation of dataset used on Notebooks #01 to #05.

TODOs:

* Can reduce performance on DNN model.
* Can make more explicative graphs and texts on optional Notebooks.
* Make a better README as welcome page ;)
