# cornershop_estimator
My take on a Cornershop time estimator model.

## tl;dr:

* Final submission can be found on 
![submission.csv](/data/submission.csv), 
label is ``total_minutes``
* Main explanation on model used for submission found on Notebook 
![00_Model](/00_Model.ipynb).

* Explanation of how dataset was created
can be found on Notebooks 
![01](/01_DatabaseCheck.ipynb), ![02](/02_OrderProducts.ipynb),
![03](/03_Shopper.ipynb), ![04](/04_StoreBranches.ipynb) and
![05](/05_Orders.ipynb).

What I would perfect over time:

* Can squeeze a better performance on Tensorflow DNN model.
* Can make more explicative graphs and texts on optional Notebooks.
* Make a better README as welcome page ;)
